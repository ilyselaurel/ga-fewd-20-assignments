            <p>This is Carl.  Carl is a two month old golden retriever who doesn't just enjoy sitting on his sisters face... but who loves to go on long walks, play with his toys, and take long naps on any availble lap.</p>
            <p>You can follow Carl on his instagram account "Life With Carl."  There he shares his snuggles, playtime, and just plain cuteness!</p>
